# calc_dev
Source files for a javascript-driven calculator I created for [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com).

The calculator is fully responsive, and can be used both using a mouse, keyboard or touchscreen.
Illegal expressions are handled gracefully and friendly suggestions are shown.

For this project, I decided to give CoffeeScript a try. Loving it so far

Using: HTML, SASS and CoffeeScript.

The final result can be seen [here](https://sroelants.github.io/Calc).
